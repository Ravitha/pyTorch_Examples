# pyTorch_Examples

Experiment 1 - Evaluate a linear model y = wx on sample data points using fixed w 
Experiment 2 - Use SGD to adjust weights of the linear model based on MSE loss 
Experiment 3 - Expressing linear model as Neural Network in pyTorch
Experiment 4 - Implementation of logistic regression model
               y = sigmoid(wx + b)
               Loss Function - Binary Cross ENtropy Loss
Experiment 5 - Reading input from text file and train the logistic regression model
