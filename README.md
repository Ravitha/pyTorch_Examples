# pyTorch_Examples

Experiment 1 - Evaluate a linear model y = wx on sample data points using fixed w <br />
Experiment 2 - Use SGD to adjust weights of the linear model based on MSE loss <br/>
Experiment 3 - Expressing linear model as Neural Network in pyTorch<br/>
Experiment 4 - Implementation of logistic regression model<br/>
               y = sigmoid(wx + b)<br/>
               Loss Function - Binary Cross Entropy Loss<br/>
Experiment 5 - Reading input from text file and train the logistic regression model<br/>
